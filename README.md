Such Strange Dog Training Promotional Website

## Milestone 1 feedback
Cool! Is "Such Strange Dog" your own business? Really looking forward to this project take shape. Love the name. :D

Your idea is solid and your Use Case is good and informative. Additional details in the Persona and Goal(s) could go a long way in the design and development of the site, particularly in regards to features and functionality.

There are some issues I see between your GitHub repo and your deployment. I see that your deployment has the proper directory structure, but this is not reflected on GitHub. Please see "Edits &amp; Suggestions" below. Your HTML looks good.

Your Milestone passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin on [Milestone 2 &alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/) 

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- There's some strange things going on between your deployment and GitHub repo. It looks like your current work has not been committed and pushed! Senator Arlo reminds you to please to commit early and often. This is very important.
- I don't see your `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, or `README.md` uploaded to bootcamp-coders. Make sure *Automatic Upload* is turned on in your Deployment settings. It's important for a project to be properly synced up.
