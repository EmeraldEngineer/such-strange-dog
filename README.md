Such Strange Dog Training Promotional Website

## Milestone 1 feedback
Cool! Is "Such Strange Dog" your own business? Really looking forward to this project take shape. Love the name. :D

Your idea is solid and your Use Case is good and informative. Additional details in the Persona and Goal(s) could go a long way in the design and development of the site, particularly in regards to features and functionality.

There are some issues I see between your GitHub repo and your deployment. I see that your deployment has the proper directory structure, but this is not reflected on GitHub. Please see "Edits &amp; Suggestions" below. Your HTML looks good.

Your Milestone passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin on [Milestone 2 &alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/) 

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- There's some strange things going on between your deployment and GitHub repo. It looks like your current work has not been committed and pushed! Senator Arlo reminds you to please to commit early and often. This is very important.
- I don't see your `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, or `README.md` uploaded to bootcamp-coders. Make sure *Automatic Upload* is turned on in your Deployment settings. It's important for a project to be properly synced up.

## Milestone 2a feedback
Excellent work on your wireframes, and you have some cool layout ideas here. I would like to hear about what your layout and UI design ideas are in more detail since it's a bit unclear to me based on the wireframes alone how the different sections of the site will be structured and how the transitions between each section will work.

Be careful regarding the amount or horizontal space on narrow screens - this _could_ affect your top nav on mobile. Also, I'm not sure you need both a navigation menu and the navigation tiles on the "splash" view. This is a little bit redundant. Don't forget to plan to include a contact form.

I think this is going to be a beautiful layout, and I'm looking forward to seeing your project take shape. Your Milestone 2a passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric). You're now clear to begin development on your PWP.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- I have to totally give you crap for neglecting to include the `alt` attribute on your image.
- `<meta charset="utf-8">` tag is missing
- Watch your indentation
